Sample JS Project Proposal: F1 Season Visualization
Background

Formula 1 racing is a globally recognized motorsport that attracts millions of fans. Each season consists of multiple races on various tracks, with different weather conditions, car marques, and race results. This project aims to provide an interactive visualization of an F1 season using vanilla DOM manipulation and canvas.
Functionality & MVPs

With this F1 Season Visualization, users will be able to:

    Select Different Seasons and Races: View different seasons, tracks, and race results.
    Interactive Track Visualization: Explore the selected track layout, with features like zooming and panning.
    View Weather and Track Conditions: Get real-time weather information and track conditions using API data.
    Explore Car Marques and Race Results: Access detailed information about different car marques, race results, driver standings, etc.

In addition, this project will include:

    An About Modal: Describing the background of F1 racing, the rules, and how to interact with the visualization.
    A Production README.

Wireframes





    Nav Links: Include links to this project's GitHub repo, LinkedIn, and an About modal.
    Game Controls: Include controls to select different races, tracks, or seasons, and display weather, race results, etc.
    Interactive Elements: Allow users to click on different parts of the visualization for more details.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

    The Canvas API: To render the track visualization.
    Vanilla DOM Manipulation: To handle interactivity and display data.
    Weather and Other APIs: To fetch real-time weather data and other race-related information.
    Webpack and Babel: To bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code.
    npm: To manage project dependencies.

Implementation Timeline

NB:

    Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Set up the project, including getting webpack up and running. Create the basic layout and canvas elements. Start designing the track visualization.
    Monday: Dedicate this day to implementing track visualization and adding interactivity to the canvas. Experiment with APIs to fetch weather and other data.
    Tuesday: Focus on integrating fetched data and displaying it within the UI. Implement controls to select different seasons, races, and tracks.
    Wednesday: Finish implementing user controls and focus on styling, as well as implementing additional features like car marque details and race results.
    Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time allows, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
